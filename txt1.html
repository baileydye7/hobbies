Hobbies and Interests


As I stated earlier, my hobbies/interests are in gaming and sports for the most part. I still consistently play on Xbox 
with several of my friends, we rotate between many games like Madden, NBA 2k, any of the Call of Duty games, and some others 
sprinkled in there. We are also all very involved in sports, football is essentially my life in a way, I watch the Vols and
Steelers and I love going to games. My friends and I also have a fantasy league we are all very involved in.
